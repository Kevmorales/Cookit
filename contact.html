<h3>Peanut Butter Overnight Oats</h3>
    
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>&#189; cup unsweetened plain almond milk</li>
    <li>&#190;  Tbsp chia seeds</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp natural salted peanut butter or almond butter</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp maple syrup</li>
    <li>&#189; cup gluten-free rolled oats</li>
    <li>Sliced banana, strawberries, or raspberries</li>
    <li>Flaxseed meal or additional chia seed</li>
    <li>Granola</li>
</ul>  

<h4>Instructions</h4>

<ol>
    <li>To a mason jar or small bowl with a lid, add almond milk, chia seeds, peanut butter, and maple syrup (or other sweetener) and stir with a spoon to combine. The peanut butter doesn't need to be completely mixed with the almond milk (doing so leaves swirls of peanut butter to enjoy the next day).
    </li>
    <li>Add oats and stir a few more times. Then press down with a spoon to ensure all oats have been moistened and are immersed in almond milk.
    </li>
    <li>Cover securely with a lid or seal and set in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours) to set/soak.
    </li>
    <li>The next day, open and enjoy as is or garnish with desired toppings.
    </li>
</ol>


<p><strong>OPTIONAL: </strong>You can also heat your oats in the microwave for 45-60 seconds (just ensure there's enough room at the top of your jar to allow for expansion and prevent overflow), or transfer oats to a saucepan and heat over medium heat until warmed through. Add more liquid as needed if oats get too thick/dry.
    <i>Overnight oats will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best within the first 12-24 hours in our experience. Not freezer friendly.
        </i>

<h3>Spaghetti carbonara</h3>
    
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>100g pancetta</li>
    <li>50g pecorino cheese</li>
    <li>50g parmesan</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>350g spaghetti</li>
    <li>2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</li>
    <li>sea salt and freshly grated black pepper</li>
    <li>Granola</li>
</ul>  

<h4>Instructions</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.
    </li>
    <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
    </li>
    <li>Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.
    </li>
    <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
    </li>
    <li>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.
    </li>
    <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
    </li>
    <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.
    </li>
    <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.
    </li>
    <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
    </li>
    <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
    </li>
    <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.
    </li>
    <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.
    </li>
</ol>


<p><strong>OPTIONAL: </strong>You can also heat your oats in the microwave for 45-60 seconds (just ensure there's enough room at the top of your jar to allow for expansion and prevent overflow), or transfer oats to a saucepan and heat over medium heat until warmed through.

<h3>Chocolate cookies</h3>
    
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
    <li>1 cup dark brown sugar, firmly packed</li>
    <li>&#189; cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 &#189; teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons maple syrup (real maple syrup or pancake syrup will work)</li>
    <li>1 &#190; cup + 2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>&#190; teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>&#190; teaspoon cinnamon optional/li>
    <li>3 cups old fashioned rolled oats</li>
    <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>

</ul>  

<h4>Instructions</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Place butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer (alternatively you can use a stand mixer) until creamy.
    </li>
    <li>Add brown sugar and granulated sugar and beat until thoroughly combined.
    </li>
    <li>Add eggs, vanilla extract, and maple syrup and stir until well-combined.
    </li>
    <li>In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.
    </li>
    <li>With the mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture to the butter mixture until ingredients are completely combined.
    </li>
    <li>Add oats and chocolate chips, stirring until thoroughly combined.
    </li>
    <li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap and transfer cookie dough to the refrigerator. Chill for at least 30 minutes<sup>1</sup>.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350F (175C) and prepare cookie sheets by lining with parchment paper.
    </li>
    <li>Once dough has chilled, drop cookie dough by rounded 2 Tablespoon-sized scoops onto parchment paper, spacing cookies at least 2" apart.
    </li>
    <li>Bake on 350F (175C) for 12-13 minutes (edges should be slightly browned, centers may still be slightly underbaked but shouldn't be raw, they'll bake completely as they cool).
    </li>
    <li>Allow cookies to cool completely on the cookie sheet before enjoying.
    </li>
</ol>


<p><sup>1</sup>Dough may be chilled longer, up to several days, just keep in mind that if it sits longer than several hours it will be very firm and difficult to scoop and may need to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes or so to soften enough to scoop.
